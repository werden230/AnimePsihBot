# AnimePsihBot
Bot which can send random anime from shikimori.one
You can check this bot [here](https://t.me/animepsih993_bot)
## Anime database
This bot uses JSON database which I scraped by myself. Maybe later I'll add feature to get anime directly from Shikmori or MyAnimeList website. 
## User data database
Here I use default sqlite3 module, beacuse the database isn't such complicated to use something else.
## Commands
- /start - start bot, create new user in the database.
- /info - useless information for those who cares.
- /roll - get random anime.
- /filter - setup filters (anime rating, type and genre).
- /cancel - stop setting up filters. 
- /reset - reset filters.
- /stat - get number of times you've used /roll command.
## How to setup the bot:
1. Get your bot token from @BotFather
2. Insert token in config.py
3. You are breathtaking!
